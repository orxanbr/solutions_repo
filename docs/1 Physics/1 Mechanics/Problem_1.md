# Projectile Motion: Range vs. Launch Angle Analysis

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### Governing Equations
From Newton's laws, we derive the projectile motion equations:

**Differential Form:**
$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 0, \quad \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -g
$$

**Solutions:**
$$
x(t) = v_0\cos\theta\cdot t
$$
$$
y(t) = v_0\sin\theta\cdot t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2
$$

### Family of Solutions
For fixed \( g \), solutions form a two-parameter family based on:
- Initial velocity \( v_0 \)
- Launch angle \( \theta \)
