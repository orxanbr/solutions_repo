We consider a projectile launched with an initial velocity $$v_0$$ at an angle $$\theta$$ to the horizontal. Neglecting air resistance and assuming constant gravitational acceleration $$g$$, we derive the equations of motion.

### Equations of Motion

The horizontal and vertical positions as a function of time $$t$$ are:

$$
x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot t
$$

$$
y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
$$

### Time of Flight

The time when the projectile hits the ground $$y(t) = 0$$ is:

$$
t_{flight} = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
$$

### Range Equation

Substituting $$t_{flight}$$ into $$x(t)$$, we get the horizontal range $$R$$:

$$
R(\theta) = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$
