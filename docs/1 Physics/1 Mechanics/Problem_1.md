# Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### Governing Equations of Motion

A projectile launched with an initial velocity $$v_0$$ at an angle $$\theta$$ from horizontal can be described using two motion components:

#### Horizontal motion (constant velocity):

$$
  x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot t
$$

#### Vertical motion (accelerated motion):

$$
  y(t) = h_0 + v_0 \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
$$

Where:  
- \( h_0 \): initial height  
- \( g \): acceleration due to gravity (\(pprox 9.81\, 	ext{m/s}^2\))

Solving the vertical motion for $$y(t) = 0$$ gives the time of flight:

$$
  t = \frac{v_0 \sin(\theta) + \sqrt{(v_0 \sin(\theta))^2 + 2gh_0}}{g}
$$

### Horizontal Range

Using $$x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot t$$, the range becomes:

$$
  R = \frac{v_0 \cos(\theta)}{g} \left( v_0 \sin(\theta) + \sqrt{(v_0 \sin(\theta))^2 + 2gh_0} \right)
$$

If $$h_0 = 0$$:

$$
  R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$

### Family of Solutions

Different initial conditions ($$v_0, h_0, g$$) generate a family of parabolic trajectories.

## 2. Analysis of the Range

### Effect of Angle

- Maximum range at $$45^\circ$$ when $$h_0 = 0$$  
- $$R(\theta) = R(90^\circ - \theta)$$ â€” symmetry in angle

### Effect of Initial Velocity ($$v_0$$)

- Range increases with $$v_0^2$$

### Effect of Gravity ($$g$$)

- Range decreases with increasing $$g$$

### Effect of Launch Height ($$h_0$$)

- Increases time of flight and thus range  
- Peak range shifts to angles less than $$45^\circ$$
