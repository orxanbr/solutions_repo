# Projectile Motion Analysis: Range vs. Launch Angle

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### Derivation of Equations

We begin with Newton's second law of motion. For a projectile launched with initial velocity \( v_0 \) at angle \( \theta \), we separate the motion into horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components:

**Horizontal Motion:**
$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 0 \implies x(t) = v_0\cos(\theta)\cdot t
$$

**Vertical Motion:**
$$
\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -g \implies y(t) = v_0\sin(\theta)\cdot t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2
$$

### Key Quantities Derived

1. **Time of Flight (T):** Solved by setting y(t) = 0
   $$
   T = \frac{2v_0\sin(\theta)}{g}
   $$

2. **Maximum Height (H):** Found when vertical velocity = 0
   $$
   H = \frac{v_0^2\sin^2(\theta)}{2g}
   $$

3. **Range (R):** Horizontal distance when projectile lands
   $$
   R = \frac{v_0^2\sin(2\theta)}{g}
   $$

*This shows the range depends on three key parameters: initial velocity, launch angle, and gravity.*
