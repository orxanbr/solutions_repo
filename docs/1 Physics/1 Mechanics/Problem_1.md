# Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### Equations of Motion
Projectile motion can be derived from Newton's second law of motion. For a projectile launched with initial velocity \( v_0 \) at angle \( \theta \) from the horizontal:

\[
\begin{cases}
x(t) = v_0 \cos\theta \cdot t \\ 
y(t) = v_0 \sin\theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 
\end{cases}
\]
