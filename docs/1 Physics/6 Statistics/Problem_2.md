# Problem 2
# üéØ Estimating $\pi$ using Monte Carlo Methods

## üìò Motivation

Monte Carlo simulations are computational techniques using randomness to solve problems. One famous use: estimating $\pi$ via geometric probability. By generating random points or dropping virtual needles and checking how often they satisfy geometric conditions, we can approximate $\pi$ in a simple, visual way.

# üßÆ PART 1: Estimating $\pi$ Using a Circle

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Theoretical Foundation

Imagine a **unit circle** (radius $r = 1$) inside a square of side length 2:

- Area of square: $4$
- Area of circle: $\pi$

So, if we randomly throw points in the square, the ratio inside the circle approximates:

$$
\frac{\text{Points inside circle}}{\text{Total points}} \approx \frac{\pi}{4}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad \pi \approx 4 \cdot \frac{M}{N}
$$

Where:
- $N$ = total number of random points
- $M$ = number that land inside the circle

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Simulation Code (Python)

```python
def estimate_pi_circle(num_points=10000):
    x = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, num_points)
    y = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, num_points)
    inside = x**2 + y**2 <= 1
    pi_est = 4 * np.sum(inside) / num_points
    return pi_est
```

- **Green dots**: Points inside the circle  
- **Red dots**: Points outside  
- The ratio gives an estimate of $\pi$

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Analysis

- Accuracy improves as $N$ increases.
- Converges relatively fast with low variance.

# ü™° PART 2: Estimating $\pi$ Using Buffon's Needle

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Theoretical Foundation

Drop a needle of length $L$ on a surface with **parallel lines** spaced $D$ apart ($L \leq D$).  
Let:
- $T$ = total number of throws
- $C$ = number of crossings (needle crosses a line)

Then:

$$
\pi \approx \frac{2L \cdot T}{D \cdot C}
$$

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Simulation Code (Python)

```python
def buffon_needle(num_throws=10000, L=1.0, D=2.0):
    theta = np.random.uniform(0, np.pi/2, num_throws)
    d = np.random.uniform(0, D/2, num_throws)
    crosses = d <= (L / 2) * np.sin(theta)
    C = np.sum(crosses)
    return (2 * L * num_throws) / (D * C) if C > 0 else np.nan
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization

- **Green needles**: Cross lines  
- **Red needles**: Do not cross  
- **Dashed lines**: Evenly spaced lines

üñºÔ∏è *(Plot shows needles and line grid)*

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Analysis

- Estimates improve slowly.
- Convergence is noisy due to fewer crossings.
- Requires more samples for accurate results.

# üìä Convergence Comparison

We compare both methods by plotting $\hat{\pi}$ estimates vs number of iterations.

| Method           | Speed     | Variance   |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| Circle Method    | Fast      | Low        |
| Buffon‚Äôs Needle  | Slower    | High       |

üñºÔ∏è *(Graph shows Circle Method stabilizing faster and closer to $\pi$)*

# ‚úÖ Conclusion

- The Circle Method is simpler, faster, and more stable for estimating $\pi$.
- Buffon's Needle is elegant and geometric, but slower to converge.
- Both demonstrate how **randomness** and **probability** can be used to estimate constants.
